# ServerBackup
A plugin for Sponge servers that create backups.

How to use this plugin
-
Write this command in the console `sb` or `serverBackup` and that will create a backup of your server.

To set this command on a schedule, you could use this plugin with my plugin [CommandScheduler](https://github.com/djxy/CommandScheduler).
